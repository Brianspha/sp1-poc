# Bridge Architecture Overview (WIP)

## System Purpose

This bridge system enables trustless cross-chain asset transfers through a co-processor architecture that cryptographically verifies bridge contract states across multiple networks. The system implements a pessimistic proof model using Succinct Labs' SP1 zero-knowledge virtual machine to generate mathematical guarantees of state validity, eliminating trust assumptions beyond cryptographic primitives.
